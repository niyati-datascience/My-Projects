# Critical Analysis Task
This project addresses common issues in a machine learning pipeline and provides solutions to improve model performance and reliability.

## Issues and Remedies
### Feature Selection

1. Problem: Features were removed based only on their correlation with the target variable, leading to potential information loss.
2. Solution: Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select significant features iteratively.

### Data Splitting

1. Problem: Sorting data by credit.policy before splitting introduced bias.
2. Solution: Randomly split the dataset into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing.

### Cross-Validation Confusion

1. Problem: Misaligned cross-validation setup (_cv=9) and unclear comments.
2. Solution: Adopt 5-fold cross-validation and update comments for clarity.

### Handling Missing Values

1. Problem: Imputing with the mean skewed the data in cases with outliers.
2. Solution: Use median, mode, or advanced techniques like KNN for imputation based on data distribution.

### Imbalanced Classes

1. Problem: Unequal class distribution in the target variable (credit.policy) caused prediction bias.
2. Solution: Address imbalance using resampling techniques, collecting more data, or algorithm adjustments like SMOTE.

### Overfitting

1. Problem: The decision tree overfit the training data, with poor test performance.
2. Solution: Apply regularization, reduce tree complexity, and consider ensemble methods for better generalization.
By implementing these remedies, the project aims to enhance the machine learning pipelineâ€™s accuracy and robustness.
