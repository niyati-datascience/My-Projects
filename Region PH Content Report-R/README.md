# Nitrate-PH-Permeability Analysis of Orana and Riverina Regions

## Overview
This analysis explores a simulated dataset of 247 samples from the Orana and Riverina regions, focusing on nitrate content, pH level, and permeability. The main objectives were:
1. To test if there is a difference in average nitrate content between the two regions.
2. To explore the relationship between pH levels and permeability.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Difference in Average Nitrate Content**
A two-sample t-test was conducted to compare nitrate content between Orana and Riverina regions. The **p-value** (0.8467) was greater than 0.05, meaning we failed to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in nitrate content between the two regions.

### 2. **Relationship Between pH and Permeability**
A simple linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between pH and permeability. The model showed a strong positive correlation, with an **R-squared** of 82.19%, indicating that 82.19% of the variance in pH can be explained by permeability. For every unit increase in permeability, pH increased by approximately 0.0546 units.

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**
A correlation of 0.9066 between pH and permeability suggests a strong positive relationship. Both regions (Orana and Riverina) showed similar patterns, with positive correlations of 0.71 and 0.86, respectively.

## Conclusion
1. There is no significant difference in nitrate levels between the Orana and Riverina regions.
2. A strong positive linear relationship exists between pH and permeability, with permeability being a significant predictor of pH levels.

## Limitations
- The sample size may not fully represent real-world variations.
- Other environmental or geographical factors that may influence nitrate and permeability were not considered.

## Recommendations
- Future studies could include larger sample sizes and additional variables for a more comprehensive analysis.
